# Overview
This repo contains my solutions to Kattis problems. [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) is a website that offers many different programming problems. I first started solving some Kattis problems when my professor [Steven Halim](https://open.kattis.com/users/stevenhalim)(Rank 9 with a score of 5543.9) introduced it in his CS2040C class.
